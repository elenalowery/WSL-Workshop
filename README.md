## About this repository
This repository contains several lab subfolders. Some labs include notebooks and data, while others have additional instructions that are located in the *Lab Instructions* folder. 

## Prerequisites
1. Knowledge of analytics. These labs do not teach you the basics of analytics or how to implement analytics in R, Python and SPSS. The purpose of this workshop is to provide hands-on experience with analytics tools and deployment functions in DSX. 
2. To run this workshop you need an instance of DSX Local. **Please note that while most code is the same between DSX Local and Watson Studio, the notebooks included in sample projects will work in DSX Local only**
3. Download and unzip this [this repository](https://codeload.github.com/elenalowery/DSX_Local_Workshop_12/zip/master). Unzip the repository only, not files in subfolders. 

### Setting up lab projects in DSX Local
1. Rename **DSX_Demos.zip** located in **DSX Local Projects** folder of the unzipped repository to a unique name, for example, add your initials.    *Note: Project names in DSX Local cluster must be unique. When we create a project "from file", the project name is inherited from the file name*. 
2. Log in to DSX Local.
3. Select "Create New Project" and select "From File".
4. Browse to the .zip file and click **Create**.
